## Features and Benefits

EnhancedXV6 is an improvement of the xv6 operating system, designed to make existing tasks easier, safer, and more efficient. Here are some key features and benefits of EnhancedXV6:

1. **Large File Support:** By implementing doubly-indirect blocks, EnhancedXV6 significantly increases the maximum file size that can be handled by the operating system. This allows users to work with more extensive data sets and larger multimedia files, thus expanding the range of applications and use cases for the xv6 operating system.

2. **Symbolic Links:** EnhancedXV6 introduces symbolic links (soft links) that allow users to create references to other files or directories across different locations. This feature greatly simplifies file management and organization, enabling users to maintain cleaner directory structures and easily access frequently-used files.

3. **Advanced System Calls:** EnhancedXV6 adds new system calls, such as `getcount` and `v2paddr`, providing users with valuable information and functionality. The `getcount` system call allows users to obtain the number of times a specific system call has been invoked, while the `v2paddr` system call translates virtual addresses to physical addresses. These advanced system calls enable developers to better understand their programs' behavior and optimize performance.

4. **Improved Safety and Robustness:** The addition of new system calls and features to EnhancedXV6 has been carefully designed and tested to ensure it maintains the safety and robustness of the original xv6 operating system. Users can enjoy the benefits of the new features without compromising the stability of their environment.
